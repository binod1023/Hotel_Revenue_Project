# Hotel_Revenue_Project

## Overview
This data analysis project is done to analyze the revenue collected by hotel in three years period. The main focus will be to answer these questions: Is hotel revenue increasing by year? Do we need more parking space in coming year? What trend do we see in the data?

## Prequisitie
Excel,
SQL, and
Power BI

## Description
Excel files on hotel from 2018 to 2020, meal cost, and discount segment are uploaded. 
Then database is created on SQL server. The data from 2018, 2019, and 2020 are combined with the tables of meal cost and discount 
I explored on how revenue is changing in three periods in which types of hotel. In addition, I determined which months are busiest in each year.
I calculated how many parking spaces are used for three years. 
Then I used the single querry that combined all five tables to export the data to Power BI.
In Power BI, I calculated metrices such as total_night, and parking_percentage. 
Finally, I visualized the findings in Power BI dashboard. I showed how revenue is changing by hotel type, and guest's country. I showed trend of total night spend by guest, daily average rate of guests' stay, and space required for car parking.
